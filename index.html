                <h1>NFL Play Analysis</h1>
                <p>The eternal debate in NFL strategy centers on the balance between rushing and passing plays. As the league has evolved, teams have developed diverse approaches to moving the ball downfield, each with their own risks and rewards. Through a detailed analysis of NFL play data, we can uncover patterns that reveal how teams utilize these two fundamental aspects of football and their impact on game outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Team Performance</h2>
                <p>Looking at the relationship between rushing and passing yards, we see a fascinating disparity in how teams distribute their offensive production. While most teams accumulate between 15,000 and 35,000 passing yards compared to 6,000-16,000 rushing yards, there's significant variation in their approaches. Some teams maintain a balanced attack, while others lean heavily on their passing game, reflecting both their roster strengths and offensive philosophies. The average yards per play further highlights this distinction, with passing plays typically gaining more yards but coming with increased risk.</p>

                <p class="description">
                    The distribution of play outcomes reveals the risk-reward nature of passing versus rushing. Passing plays show a wider variance in outcomes, ranging from incomplete passes and interceptions to big gains downfield. In contrast, rushing plays demonstrate more consistent, albeit usually smaller, gains. This visualization helps explain why teams often rely on rushing plays in critical situations where ball security is paramount, despite the allure of bigger gains through the air.

                <h2>Scoring Drive Distribution</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    Analyzing scoring drives provides insight into how teams construct their successful offensive series. While passing plays often feature prominently in quick-scoring drives, especially when teams are trailing, rushing plays become increasingly important in longer drives that help control game tempo and wear down defensive units. This balance between explosive passing plays and methodical rushing attacks often defines a team's scoring identity.

                <h2>Turnover Location</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The spatial distribution of turnovers tells a compelling story about risk management. Interceptions tend to occur more frequently in certain areas of the field, particularly on longer passing attempts, while fumbles on rushing plays show a more uniform distribution. This pattern influences play-calling decisions, especially in different field positions where the risk of turning over the ball could dramatically swing game momentum.

                <h2>Game Context Analysis</h2>
                <p class="section-description">
                    The influence of game situation on play-calling reveals how teams adapt their rushing-passing balance. In early downs with manageable distances, teams maintain a relatively even distribution between runs and passes. However, as downs progress or in obvious passing situations (like third-and-long or when trailing late), the balance shifts dramatically toward passing plays. This visualization demonstrates how game context forces teams to sometimes abandon their preferred offensive balance.

                        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                        The data paints a picture of modern NFL offense as a complex ecosystem where rushing and passing plays serve complementary roles. While passing plays dominate in terms of total yardage and remain the primary vehicle for explosive plays, rushing plays provide stability, ball control, and crucial tactical advantages in specific game situations. The most successful teams aren't necessarily those that excel in one aspect, but those that can effectively blend both elements while minimizing their respective risks. This balance, tailored to each team's personnel and adjusted for game context, continues to define offensive success in the NFL.
